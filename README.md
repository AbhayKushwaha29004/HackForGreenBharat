🚀 DINOv2-Segmentation: High-Precision Feature DistillationA production-grade Semantic Segmentation pipeline that leverages Meta's DINOv2 (Self-Supervised Vision Transformers) to achieve surgical pixel-precision with minimal computational overhead.📝 Project EssenceTraditional segmentation models require massive datasets and heavy compute. This project demonstrates efficiency-driven AI by using a frozen DINOv2 backbone and a custom-trained segmentation head. It effectively bridges the gap between self-supervised foundation models and dense downstream tasks.📊 Key Results & PerformanceThe model was trained for 40 epochs on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti. The training showed exceptional stability and convergence:Final Training Loss: 0.3347 (Reduced from 1.0908)Best Validation IoU: 0.7062Convergence Status: High stability achieved post-epoch 30.Training DynamicsMilestoneTrain LossVal IoUStatusEpoch 11.09080.6579Initial BaselineEpoch 200.34480.7032Stabilization PhaseEpoch 340.33540.7062Peak PerformanceEpoch 400.33470.7058Final Convergence🛠️ Technical StackBackbone: dinov2_vits14 (Frozen weights)Segmentation Head: Custom Linear/Convolutional DecoderOptimizer: AdamW with Weight DecayPlatform: PyTorch with CUDA acceleration🧠 Why DINOv2?Unlike supervised models (ResNet/EfficientNet), DINOv2 learns through Self-Supervised Distillation. This allows the model to capture high-frequency structural details and object boundaries that are often missed by standard models. Our implementation maps these high-dimensional features into a segmentation mask with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 70.62%.⚙️ Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/dinov2-segmentation.git
