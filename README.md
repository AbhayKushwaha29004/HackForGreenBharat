## 🧠 Technical Deep-Dive
Unlike traditional supervised learning, this project utilizes **Self-Supervised Foundations**. DINOv2 provides a rich understanding of object geometry and textures without needing massive labeled data for the backbone. We engineered a custom head to map these high-dimensional features into class-specific masks, resulting in a model that understands **structural context** rather than just matching pixels.
